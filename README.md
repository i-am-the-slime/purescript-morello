This work is merely connecting the dots of the amazing Purescript language and it's awesome ecosystem. A special shout-out to the contributors & maintainers of the [`profunctor-lenses`](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-profunctor-lenses), [`heterogenous`](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-heterogeneous/) and [`validation`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-validation) libraries. This library wouldn't have been possible without these.
